#My Website/CV.
I try to build an interactive resume website with animation wich remeber me old and linear games.

This took me seven days ( with less or more 8h working ours ).

My must hard goal, was to show the diffencence skill and software (technologies), I took over the time with differente working expiriences, with less enfort possible.

So I build up a simple Json scheme witch you can found in <b>Experience.js</b>, this is almost the full content of the website.
js/utils/render_experience.js

##Features
 - <b>Render single experience</b> - Parse the experience.js and get single slide with Donut Chart for summary experience details.
 - <b>Render summary charts</b> - after parsing the full experience.js return.
 - <b>Sound Track</b> - Add your favorite soundtrack from a youtube video ( https://gist.github.com/M3kH/dea521b049ed7377e377 )
